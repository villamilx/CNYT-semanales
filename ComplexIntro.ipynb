The polar form of a complex number expresses it in terms of a magnitude (r) and an angle (θ), and is written as `r(cos θ + i sin θ)` or `r∠θ`. This form is particularly useful in quantum computing, signal processing, and other fields where phase and amplitude are important.\n",

    "# 5. Application: Fractals and Complex Numbers\n",
    "    - Introduction to fractals\n",
    "    - Generating a Mandelbrot set\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Mandelbrot Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mandelbrot Set is a fascinating and complex structure in the field of fractal geometry, discovered by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980. It's a set of complex numbers that forms an intricate and infinitely detailed boundary when plotted in the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Mandelbrot Set?\n",
    "The Mandelbrot Set is defined as the set of complex numbers `c` for which the function `f(z) = z^2 + c` does not diverge when iterated from `z = 0`. In simpler terms, if repeatedly squaring the number and adding `c` never makes the value go to infinity, that number is part of the Mandelbrot Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Starting with `z = 0`, we repeatedly apply the function `f(z) = z^2 + c`. The behavior of this sequence determines if `c` is in the Mandelbrot Set.\n",
    "- **Boundedness**: If the sequence remains bounded (doesn't go to infinity), then `c` is in the Mandelbrot Set.\n",
    "- **Escape Time Algorithm**: To visualize the set, we use an algorithm that assigns a color based on how quickly the values reach a certain threshold when iterated. Points inside the set typically remain black.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the Mandelbrot Set:\n",
    "- **Self-Similarity**: The set is fractal, meaning it contains smaller copies of itself.\n",
    "- **Complex Boundary**: The boundary of the Mandelbrot Set is infinitely complex. Zooming into the boundary reveals more detail.\n",
    "- **Area**: While the exact area of the Mandelbrot Set is unknown, it is finite.\n",
    "- **Connectedness**: Despite its complexity, the set is mathematically proven to be a connected set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting the Mandelbrot Set:\n",
    "To visualize the set, we iterate over a grid of complex numbers and use the escape time algorithm to color each point. Points that remain bounded (do not escape) after a set number of iterations are considered part of the Mandelbrot Set and are usually colored black.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of the Mandelbrot Set lies not just in its visual complexity, but also in the way it bridges mathematics, art, and computer science. It serves as a powerful example of how simple rules can lead to incredibly intricate structures.\n"
